#### Baking Soda –
Baking Soda or Sodium Bicarbonate is a proven remedy for dirty Silver and Aluminium tools. 
The experts, who work in the related industries, always recommend it to clean the stubborn stains from such materials.

If you want to try it with your Kadai or Pressure Cooker, follow these steps:

Note – The excessive use of Baking Soda may cause discoloration of your Aluminium tool.

1 Sprinkle 2-3 teaspoons of Baking Soda on the surface.
2 Scrub the surface with warm water.
3 If there is no stain in the Kadai, wash it again with dishwashing soap.

> This trick should be your last option, as Aluminium reacts quickly with Sodium Bicarbonate. Try it on the old kitchen tools and see how it works.



### White Vinegar and Water –

This combination should be your next option if the hot lemon-water trick fails.
The acetic acid present in Vinegar works like wonder for the greasy utensils.

The procedure to prepare this solution is not much different from lemon-water trick. 
Follow the same steps to get the desired result.

Note – You may also apply the distilled white Vinegar directly on the sticky substances. It will soften them quickly.
